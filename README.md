# Angular 4 Course Project

A sample course project to create a small recipe managing website using Angular 4, Firebase, and AngularFire. 

Also includes a small chat app using Firebase as well for messages within the project.

## Disclaimer

Working alongside [Angular 4 - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/learn/v4/overview).

Started communication between Firebase using standard http package calls within Angular, but have since ported the DataStorageService for Firebase communication to use AngularFire.
